Since the dataset formats of each section have slightly differences, we put the scripts for each section under a separate folder. 

— The Datasets folder contains our final dataset, with 58,788 records for Final.tsv, and three auxiliary datasets as actors, actress, and plots. And the script we use to merge the after-parsing data is also included.

— The Prediction folder contains the data preprocessing java code, processed datasets and the R script for the main prediction job.

— The Association_Rules and the Clustering folder contains the R script and the datasets being used.
